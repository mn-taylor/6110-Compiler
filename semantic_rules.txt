Semantic Rules to check for
 - Should have a main method that has type void and take no paramaters
 - Integer Range Checking
    - int 32 bits
    - long 64 bits
 - Arrays must be declared with integral size
 - All identifiers must be defined before use
 - A method calls come after their declaration. 
    - Only check global scope for method calls
 - No identifier can be defined more than once in the same scope
 - Field and method names must all be distinct in the global scope
 - When checking that method parameters are not defined again in the body, compare method params with every scope below.
 - Len can only be called on arrays, and it returns an int, can be replaced since its evaluated at compile time.
 - An Int and long can be cast into each other, while a bool can not be cast to a numerical type,
 - All external functions are treated as it they return an int.
 - We don't need to check that external arguments
