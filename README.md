# 6.1100 Decaf Compiler Rust Skeleton

In this repo you will find a skeleton for the Decaf compiler project. You may organize this project in any way you see fit as long as the build.sh and run.sh files build and run your compiler respectively.

This project uses the `cargo` build tool. The recommended way to install it is to install `rustup`, for more details, see: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.
